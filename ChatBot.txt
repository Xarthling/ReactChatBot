Step 1: Core Chat Functionality
Implement ChatBox Enhancements:

Add a dropdown for selecting documents from the uploaded documents list.
Attach the selected document as metadata to the chat message.
Display attached document references in the UI as Attached: <Document Name> until explicitly removed.
Ensure no page reloads during this process.
Handle New Chats and Existing Chats:

"New Chat" button triggers an API call with chat_id: null to start a new chat.
Clicking on a chat from history loads the corresponding chat messages into the ChatBox.
Step 2: Chat History Enhancements
Display Chat List:

List chat names with a placeholder for empty states: "No chats yet. Start a new conversation!".
Use useState to dynamically update the chat list when a new chat is created or deleted.
Add Hover Actions for Chats:

Download Chat: Clicking downloads the chat as a JSON file.
Delete Chat: Clicking removes the chat from the list without reloading the page.
Implement hover icons that only appear when hovering over a chat.
Step 3: Uploaded Documents Enhancements
Display Uploaded Documents:

List uploaded documents with a placeholder: "No documents uploaded. Upload one to get started!".
Use useState to dynamically update the document list when a new document is uploaded or deleted.
Add Hover Actions for Documents:

Delete Document: Clicking removes the document from the list without reloading the page.
Hover icons for delete should appear on hover.
Step 4: Mock API Integration
Set Up mockApi.js:

Create mock APIs for the following:
Fetching uploaded documents.
Fetching chat history.
Fetching chat messages.
Creating/continuing a chat.
Uploading/deleting documents and chats.
Connect Components to Mock APIs:

Use these mock APIs in the relevant components (ChatBox, ChatHistory, UploadDocuments) for realistic behavior.
Step 5: UI & State Management
Dynamic Updates Without Page Reloads:

Ensure document uploads, chat deletions, and new chat creations update the respective components without refreshing the page.
Use useState to manage local state for:
Chat History: chatHistory state.
Uploaded Documents: uploadedDocuments state.
Chat Messages: currentChatMessages state.
Placeholders for Empty States:

Add placeholders for chat history and uploaded documents when there’s no data.
Hover Effects:

Add hover effects for delete and download icons in chat history and uploaded documents.
Step 6: Styling & Responsiveness
Dynamic Responsiveness:

Use Tailwind CSS to ensure the app works on different screen sizes.
Sidebar collapses gracefully on smaller screens.
Scrollable sections for uploaded documents and chat history.
Consistency in Hover Actions:

Use Tailwind utilities to style hover icons for visibility and user clarity.
Step 7: Testing
Test Core Features:

Check chat creation, message handling, and chat history loading.
Validate attachment functionality for selected documents.
Test document uploads and hover actions for delete.
Debug State Management:

Ensure useState updates dynamically without breaking other components.
Validate that no actions (new chat, document upload) trigger full page reloads.

Steps:
Step 1: Set Up Basic Project Structure
Initialize a Vite project with React template:
npm create vite@latest chatbot-app --template react
Install dependencies:
Install Tailwind CSS for styling.
Install React Router for page navigation.
Set up the Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js) and integrate it into your project (index.css).
Step 2: Create Core Layout and Routing
Define app layout:
Set up a basic layout where the app is divided into two main areas: a sidebar (on the left) and a main content area (on the right).
Set up routing for different pages:
/auth → Login/Registration Page (AuthPage.jsx).
/chat → Chat Interface (ChatPage.jsx).
Sidebar components:
For now, just show the static structure (icons and sections), with no interaction yet.
Step 3: Sidebar Setup (Collapsible, Hover Behavior)
Create the Sidebar Component (Sidebar.jsx):
Inside, structure the sidebar with the following sections:
New Chat (icon)
Uploaded Documents (icon)
Chat History (icon)
User Settings (icon)
Logout (icon)
Collapsible Sidebar:
The sidebar should initially be collapsed, only showing icons.
When the user hovers over the collapsed sidebar, it should expand and show text labels beside the icons.
Hover Behavior:
When hovering over a collapsed sidebar, it should expand to reveal the text.
The text should auto-hide when the hover is removed, collapsing back to the icon-only view.
Step 4: ChatPage Layout and Basic Chat Interface
Create ChatPage.jsx:
Define a container that will hold:
The Sidebar component on the left.
The ChatBox component on the right, which will display messages.
Structure of ChatBox:
Placeholder for chat messages.
A text input field for the user to send messages.
A basic static response system (you’ll implement later).
No actual functionality yet for messages or user input—just laying out the UI.
Step 5: Create Chat History UI
Create ChatHistory.jsx:
Show a list of past chats. Each entry will show the name of the chat (for now, static data).
No message previews yet—only the chat name.
Ensure that the list is scrollable if there are too many chats.
Hover Effects:
When hovering over a chat entry, show delete and download icons.
Clicking delete removes the chat from the list (don’t trigger a page reload).
Clicking download triggers the download of that chat as a JSON file.
Step 6: Upload Documents Interface
Create UploadDocuments.jsx:
Allow the user to upload documents (e.g., PDF, Word, Text).
Display a list of uploaded documents with their names.
Hover Effects on Documents:
When hovering over a document, show a delete icon.
Clicking delete removes the document from the list (again, no page reload).
Ensure the document list is scrollable if too many documents are uploaded.
Step 7: Set Up State Management
Use useState for managing local states within components:
chatHistory: Stores the list of chat sessions (names of chats).
uploadedDocuments: Stores the uploaded documents (file names and metadata).
currentChatMessages: Stores messages for the current chat session.
Update states dynamically when new chats are created, documents are uploaded, or messages are sent.
Step 8: Mock API Responses
Create mock APIs for:
Creating new chats.
Fetching chat history.
Fetching messages for a given chat.
Uploading and deleting documents.
Mock Chat Creation:
A call with chat_id: null will be considered as creating a new chat (assign a new chat_id).
Mock Document Upload:
Return a file name or reference when a document is uploaded (no actual file storage yet).
Mock Document and Chat Deletion:
Implement mock logic for deleting a chat or document from the list.
Step 9: Integration of Hover Effects
Hover over Sidebar:
Ensure the sidebar collapses and expands only when hovering over it.
Add transitions for smooth collapse/expand behavior (using Tailwind CSS for animations).
Hover over Chat History and Documents:
Display delete and download icons only when the user hovers over an item in the chat history or document list.
Ensure these icons are styled and positioned clearly, and the actions trigger without page reloads.
Step 10: Test Layout & Interactions
Test all hover-based interactions:
Verify that the sidebar collapses and expands smoothly on hover.
Ensure the chat history and document hover actions work correctly (showing delete/download icons and triggering actions).
Check the dynamic updating of states:
Add new chats and documents and check that the state updates without page reloads.
Step 11: Finalize UI/UX
Polish UI:
Apply final styling adjustments (using Tailwind) to ensure that components are visually appealing.
Make sure everything is mobile responsive (the sidebar collapses appropriately on smaller screens).
Final Testing:
Perform cross-browser and device testing to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
Step 12: Prepare for API Integration
API Integration Planning:
Once the basic UI and mockups are working smoothly, prepare for replacing mock APIs with real ones (authentication, chat management, file handling).
